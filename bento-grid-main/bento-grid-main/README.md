## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project taught me a lot about combining CSS Grid and Flexbox for creating responsive layouts. Here are some key takeaways:

CSS Grid Layout: I became comfortable using CSS Grid to create flexible, responsive grid layouts that automatically adjust depending on the screen size.

Flexbox: Flexbox helped align and distribute space among grid items, making it easier to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.

Responsive Design: I focused on making the grid layout responsive using media queries to ensure it looks great on all devices, from mobile to desktop.

### Continued development

I will continue to improve my understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox by working on similar responsive layouts. I also plan to explore:

Advanced CSS animations
Progressive enhancement techniques for web accessibility
Performance optimization for larger web applications
