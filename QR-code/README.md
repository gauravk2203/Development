## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

While building this project, I improved my understanding of Flexbox for layout alignment. I also got hands-on experience with creating reusable CSS components.

Here's a snippet of CSS I'm proud of:

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:
- Improve accessibility by focusing more on ARIA roles.
- Use CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Dive deeper into CSS animations for interactive elements.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped me align elements perfectly.
- [MDN Web Docs - CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - My go-to reference for CSS properties.
