## My Process  

### Built With  

- **Semantic HTML5** for accessible and meaningful structure  
- **CSS Flexbox** for layout and responsiveness  
- **Media Queries** for mobile-first responsive design  
- **Mobile-first workflow** to prioritize small-screen usability  

### Continued Development  

In future projects, I plan to:  
- Dive deeper into advanced **Flexbox** techniques for complex layouts.  
- Experiment with CSS animations to make designs more interactive.  
- Incorporate accessibility best practices to enhance usability.
