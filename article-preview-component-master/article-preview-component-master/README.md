## Overview

### The Challenge

The objective was to build a responsive article preview component that allows users to:

- View an optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
- Interact with the component by clicking the share button to reveal social media links.

This project tests skills in responsive design, interactivity, and efficient HTML and CSS structuring.
