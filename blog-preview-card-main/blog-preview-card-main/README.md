## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts for typography

### What I Learned

This project reinforced my understanding of:

1. **Flexbox:** For aligning and distributing elements within the blog card.
2. **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the card adapts well to different screen sizes using media queries.
3. **Hover Effects:** Making the title interactive with a hover effect.

Hereâ€™s an example of the hover effect:

```css
.active:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  cursor: pointer;
}
```
