## My Process

### Built With

This project came to life with:

- **Semantic HTML5** for clean, structured markup.
- **CSS custom properties** to keep the design dynamic and reusable.
- **Flexbox & CSS Grid** for a robust, responsive layout.
- A **mobile-first workflow**, ensuring the design works seamlessly on smaller screens before scaling up.

### Future Aspirations

I’m always looking to level up my craft! Here’s what I plan to tackle next:

- Enhancing **accessibility** with improved ARIA roles and seamless keyboard navigation.
- Experimenting with **CSS container queries** to create even more adaptable layouts.
- Adding **subtle animations** to inject a dose of charm into the user experience.
